# How do I spin up the project locally on Mac? 

Note: Make sure `Node` and `PostgresDB` are installed on your machine first.

## 1.) First Download Python3 and Pip (Python's package manager)
`$ brew install python3`

## 2.) Make sure Git is installed (We will be using this alot)
`$ brew install git`

## 3.) (this step is optional) Use Homebrew to install the graphical libraries necessary for PDF creation:
`$ brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi`

## Clone the project 
`git clone https://github.com/alecluna/printworksapparel.git`

## 4.) Go into the project directory:
`cd printworksapparel`

## 5.) Install and update the Python existing dependencies: (this is where I ran into a little trouble with pip, try using pip3 as an alternative because your python version might not support a dependency that Saleor uses.)
`$pip install -r requirements.txt` or `$pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## 6.) Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. I changed mine to `stingersup` This is for security reasons when developing.
`$ export SECRET_KEY='stingersup'`

## 7.) Spin up the database, this populates it with dummy data:
`$ python manage.py migrate`

## 8.) Install front-end, JS dependencies: (if you have trouble here, make sure Node is symlinked correctly,  and that you are in the main home directory for `printworksapparel/`
`npm install`



## 9.) Prepare front end assets: 
`$ npm run build-assets`

## 10 Compile emails (not sure what this does yet)
`$ npm run build-emails`

## Spin up the python dev server!!! 
`$ python manage.py runserver`
