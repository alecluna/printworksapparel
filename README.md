## How Do I Spin up This Project Locally?

• clone the repo and run `npm install` or `yarn`

• Change out the `.env` variables inside the `src/functions` lambda functions. Consult another team member in order to get these credentials

• Next, run the lambda serve function using `npm run lambda-serve` or `yarn run lambda-serve`

• Once the lambda functions are running locally, we qre able to run the html files. Simply copy and paste the relative path of the files or run `Go Live` on VSCode.
